# Docker Compose V2 Studies

Welcome to my repository where I explore the functionalities and advantages of Docker Compose as part of my containerization journey.

## Introduction to Docker Compose

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application's services, networks, and volumes, and then with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.

## Objectives

- [ ] Understand the YAML syntax for Docker Compose files.
- [ ] Learn how to define and run multi-container applications with Docker Compose.
- [ ] Explore volume and network configurations for complex applications.
- [ ] Practice building and deploying a variety of applications using Docker Compose.
- [ ] Master Docker Compose commands and workflows.
- [ ] Investigate best practices for Docker Compose in development and production environments.
- [ ] Create a docker-compose catalog to speed-up my home-labs.
